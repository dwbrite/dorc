TODO: add badges

`dorc` is the deployment orchestrator for people who are too lazy to setup docker containers and kubernetes for 
something simple like their website, but who still want to have blue-green deploys. You still have to set up CI/CD tho :/

This version of `dorc` is being uploaded as a placeholder until 0.1.0 is ready.
